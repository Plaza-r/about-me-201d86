      Hello! My name is, Yajahira 'Yari' Velazquez. I am a army veteran, a mom, and a wife. My family's legacy is one of service, so naturally I followed in their footsteps and  joined the military. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the military. During that time, I was able to finish an, Associate of Science in Criminal Justice. When I first started out, I wanted to do something in the criminal justice sector, so, my first job in the army was as military police. Then in 2002, I was deployed in that capacity. When I got back, I changed jobs to transportation management. I didn't last too long in that job. I was transferred to a medical unit where I was retrained as a preventive medicine sergeant. That's when I decided what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.
      
      After I got out, I decided I wanted to go to medical school, so I went to my parents alma mater in Dominican Republic. Life had other plans for me though. So, with just a year and half to graduation, I had to switch gears and reinvent myself. I decided to start my own business, leveraging my skills from hobbies, the military, and experiences. It was trying to make this business work, that I understood I needed to dig deeper. 
  
      My goal is to build a business that not only creates, but that invests in different sectors. I want to build something that my kids can continue to build on. I want to do more than my parents did.
