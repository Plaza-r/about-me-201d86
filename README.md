### Lab 2

#### Today's Reflections

>What I thought was going to be scary but easy to learn, simply because of my interest, I now realize will have areas where grey will be the norm. *What do I mean?* I am beginning to understand that in coding, while it may "appear" black and white, it isn't. While I had seen today's lesson in Code 102, today it clicked. There are ways around the "rules". That is the grey. 
>
>Moving forward, I will try to stay ahead in the reading, because today I saw things that were in the reading and that later became relevant in the lab. I have become a visual/audio learner, so doing the exercises along with the instructor has been beneficial. The demos especially are helpful in clarifying the doubts.

>If I can get through the lab with minimal help, then I know, and feel, I am on the right track.
